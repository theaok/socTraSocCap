\begin{abstract}
\noindent We investigate the effect of social transfers (especially pension) and
social capital (especially volunteering) on subjective wellbeing (SWB) of
elderly using the latest wave 6 of Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe
(SHARE). We find that the effect of volunteering on SWB is not much smaller or
even about as large as that of pensions. The most SWB is associated with volunteering about
every week, but there is already a substantial effect even if one volunteers only
about every month. 
We also find that the higher the income or wealth, but not pension, the lower
the effect of volunteering.  
High European pensions may be unsustainable in the long run--we argue that
 promotion of volunteering is one way to increase elderly's subjective wellbeing amidst tightening budgets.

Population aging will be the key issue in this century, and perhaps even in 
the third
millennium  \citep{stolnitz1992demographic}. Specifically, there are growing
concerns about sustainability of pensions and health care \citep{jurges12}. 
The problem of aging is clear in many European countries, e.g., in
Germany, Europe's most populous country, and there is clearly a need for social
science research to address aging as one of the most important challenges of our
times \citep{vaupel2006redistributing}. 
%
Amidst growing concerns about sustainability of pensions and health care, there
is much need to investigate alternative ways  of sustaining and increasing  the wellbeing of
the elderly. % and what are the tradeoffs.
 In present study % predicting SWB
we are especially interested in whether the effect of volunteering is comparable
to that of pensions. In other words, we
study how much SWB is dervied from economic v social capital. 
% substitution between economic
% capital (social transfers) v social capital (volunteering).
% latest: AH NOT SURE NOT REALLY DOINGH ANY SUBSTITUTION TEST OR ANYTHING,

% MAYBE use this terminology more;
                                %definietly at least one more guess at the end
%collective social policy and individual believes/values.
%  We will also control for a number of person-level characteristics.
%Our audience is broad--anybody interested in well-being and quality of life.

Volunteering has been advocated by the United Nations, American and European
governments as a way to engage people in their local communities and improve
social capital, with the potential for public health benefits such as improved 
health and overall wellbeing 
\citep{jenkinson2013volunteering}. Promotion of volunteering could be an
alternative 
strategy to sustained social transfers in an effort to achieve a decent
wellbeing.  For other strategies see \citet[][sec. 2.4.5]{ferring10}. 

There is a need for new knowledge: better understanding of the determinants of
SWB enables to evaluate and possibly reform present retirement
institutions, such as pension programs, as well
as potentially generate new institutions to meet the demands of rapidly
increasing retirement population. SWB can serve as a yardstick to evaluate
relative strength and net effect from each factor. In present study, we will use SWB
to measure net effects of social transfers and social capital--we will control
for both in one model.

There is a growing recognition of subjective  well-being and quality of life
indicators \citep{aok_lsPol16}. Traditional
measures of development, such as income, production, or consumption are too
simplistic. They do not capture the overall progress of our civilization. For
instance, gross domestic product increases when there is traffic congestion, but
clearly that is not 
progress. But even increase in household income does not necessarily
 create progress if there is growing income inequality. 
Other important ingredients of overall development and progress such as
discretionary time, mental and physical health are not captured by monetary measures. We will
capture overall progress by using SWB yardstick.

%
 % Research focusing on aging and happiness takes into account income, but either
 % overlooks social transfers or volunteering or both.
 We start with a general hypothesis about social
 transfers and social capital, which is multi-dimensional, and we focus  on volunteering:\\
\noindent$H_1:$ The more social transfers and social capital, especially in the
form of volunteering, the more SWB.\\

Studies focusing on elderly and their wellbeing, either miss social
transfers or volunteering (they do not examine them simultaneously), and they
often measure only specific domains of wellbeing, not overall wellbeing. We
hypothesize some degree of tradeoff or substitution between social capital and
social transfers. The more social capital, especially in the form of volunteering,
the lower the need for social transfers to achieve SWB.\\ 

\noindent$H_2:$ When considered simultaneously pensions and volunteering have about the same effect on SWB.\\ 

The above were our initial hypotheses we set off with for this project. In the
course of analysis, we have discovered an interaction between income, wealth, and
volunteering and we will report these results at the end. 

\section{SWB} 

SWB is multidimensional. Hedonic dimension is about prevalence of pleasure over
pain. Eudamonic dimension is about ``good life.'' There is affective momentary
happiness, and there is cognitive evaluative life satisfaction. There is some
overlap between the two, and there even more dimensions. Notably there are domain satisfactions:
community, financial, and so forth. For elaboration and discussion see \citet{diener09,diener04s,veenhoven08,kahneman99,campbell76etal}.

We will use two measures that are overall or all-inclusive, as opposed to
confined to a domain or domains, and are mostly cognitive and evaluative
as opposed to affective and momentary: single item life satisfaction question
and CASP scale \citep{hyde03,hyde15}. Life satisfaction is rather hedonic. CASP
scale is more comprehensive and includes some eudamonic items as discussed later.

CASP can be conceptualized as Control, Autonomy, Self-realization, and Pleasure \citep{hyde03,hyde15}.
CASP is often referred to as quality of life (QOL) measure, however, it is probably better understood as SWB measure--QOL measures are rather
objective \citep{aok13liavbility,aok-swbLivability18}. We also follow
\citet{vanhoutte12,vanhoutte14} who also considers CASP to be a SWB measure.

One could take volunteer process perspective and approach volunteering
as having antecedents, consequences, but also the middle category--the
experience of volunteering \citep{wilson12B}. We study here SWB as a consequence
of volunteering and our measures of SWB are well suited for it.

% While we specifically precisely mean life satisfaction, we also use a more
% generic term subjective wellbeing or even happiness. To be clear, we always mean
% overall life satisfaction, unless indicated otherwhise. For instance, we do not
% study here financial, community or other satisfactions. 

%SWB is our dependent variable.
%  SWB can be defined as people's evaluations of
% their lives, which include ``both cognitive judgments of one's life
% satisfaction in addition to affective evaluations of mood and
% emotions'' \citep{steel08}. In other words, it is ``overall judgment of life that draws on two sources of information:
%   cognitive comparison with standards of the good life (contentment) and
%   affective information from how one feels most of the time (hedonic
%   level of affect)'' \citep{veenhoven08}.  
 % Some scholars make a
%   distinction between happiness and life satisfaction. Life
%   satisfaction refers to cognition and happiness refers to affect \citep{dorahy98etal}. In practice, however, it is usually difficult
%     if not impossible to separate the two concepts. 
% Hence, the overall happiness definition by 
%    \citet{veenhoven08}, as quoted above,  seems most appropriate and we will use
%    terms ``subjective well-being (SWB),'' ``happiness,'' and ``life
%    satisfaction'' interchangeably. 

The SWB measures, even though self-reported and
 subjective, are  reliable (precision varies) % per ruut asa13 slides
 and valid \citep{myers00,ditella06m,diener09}. 


\section{Volunteering}

% focus on def of voluntering as among elderly
% Dictionary defines volunteering as
% definintion: voluntering: altruistic, etc
% \url{https://www.google.pl/search?q=volunteering+definition&rlz=1CATAAC_enUS742US743&oq=volunteering+definition&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.4820j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8}
% The key of definition is altruism
\citet[][p.177]{wilson12B} provides a useful overview of definitions: 
%Snyder and Omoto  %from lm 
 define volunteering as
 ``freely chosen and deliberate helping activities that
extend over time, are engaged in without expectation of reward or other
compensation
and often through formal organizations, and that are performed on behalf of
causes or individuals who desire assistance.'' Another example of definition is ``unpaid help given
to another person not a member of one's family.'' The key part of definition is altruism.

Elderly are often an unused productive potential.
The literature agrees that volunteering is a productive aging strategy
\citep[e.g.,][]{wilson12B,hank09}. 
There is evidence that reward experienced from helping others may be deeply
ingrained in human nature, emerging in diverse cultural and economic contexts \citep{aknin13}.

\citet{anderson14} is a recent comprehensive review of benefits of
volunteering among seniors: volunteering is associated with reduced symptoms of
depression, better self-reported health, fewer functional limitations, and lower
mortality. The protective benefits associated with volunteering are amplified if
volunteers feel reciprocity (i.e., their work is appreciated and ``matters''), contribute their
time for prosocial reasons, and make a moderate but not excessive commitment to
volunteering. Indeed, volunteering can have negative effects, especially if done
in disaster situations (earthquakes, etc) or towards people in very difficult
situations (Ebola, etc) \citep{wilson12B}.

\citet{wilson12B} in his review lists many antecedents: again, volunteers report fewer depression symptoms. Volunteering
earlier in life predicts volunteering later in life and increased purpose in
life. It helps if one volunteers for extrinsic as opposed to intrinsic reasons. 
% Volunteering is likely to be overstated:  those who
% respond to surveys are more likely to volunteer, hence, actual volunteering in
% population is likely to be substantially lower. %p178


\section{Social Transfers}

%We know very little about the effect of social policy on wellbeing.
There is an abundant literature about the effect of welfare on SWB as recently
reviewed in \citet{aokJap14}. {Political scientists tend to focus on welfare and institutions at country
level \citep{alvarez09,pacek08b,radcliff13,pacek08r,radcliff01,bok10}. A popular
measure of welfare is a so called ``decommodification.'' % On the societal level, \citet[p. 36]{esping90} argued that ``the market becomes to the worker a prison within which it is imperative to
% behave as a commodity in order to survive.''
%  When workers feel like they are a commodity that leads to lower SWB \citep{easterlin09}.
% Additionally,  \citet{lane00} contended that  markets are indifferent
% to the fate of individuals so when there is not a safety net, people
% have lower SWB.  
Decommodification mostly means good pensions, sickness benefits,
and unemployment compensation--measurement is described in  \citet{scruggs06Ba}. Our approach is to zoom
in at person level and focus on elderly.} % There is even more research about the effect of personal income on
% happiness \citep{dolan08al,veenhoven12,helliwell14b}. 
% In general, both income and welfare increase SWB, at least up to a point. 
%
% Yet, there is clearly a gap: welfare is studied at aggregate level, usually 
% country level, and despite voluminous research linking income with SWB, there
% are very few studies about welfare or social transfers at person level, and
%  all these studies overlook social capital, notably volunteering. 
% BELOW MAYBE A FOOTNOTE TO FLOW BETTER
 There are surprisingly different relationships between SWB and its predictors
 depending on the level of analysis \citep{ashkanasy11}, and research implications can be
misguided when taken from only one level of analysis \citep{klein00}.

Many studies at person level focused on income and found that 
personal  income  increases SWB at least with diminishing returns
\citep{aok_ruut_inc_ine,kahneman10,frijters04,kushlev15,dolan08al,veenhoven12}. Yet,
this line of happiness research about personal income tends to overlook welfare
and social transfers--main reasons are probably twofold: researchers tend to
focus solely on income often following Easterlin paradox \citep{easterlin10B} and most data do
not allow for fine-grained measurement of social transfers or welfare. 
%
There are some exceptions. Notably, there is a recent experimental study \citep{oswald14}. Poor British
were given additional help from the government (training and money),  
were followed for several years, and at the end, the ones that received
additional welfare were not richer or happier than those who did not receive the
 help, if anything, they
were worse off. There is, however, no study considering simultaneously social transfers
including pensions and social capital including volunteering.

\section{Predicting SWB}

Our contribution is that we  investigate SWB among elderly
across multiple countries using large representative samples and focus on volunteering and social transfers simultaneously.  
%
Studies focusing on elderly and their wellbeing, either miss social
transfers or volunteering (they do not examine them simultaneously), and they
often measure only specific domains of wellbeing. For instance,
\citet{bender12} overlooks volunteering and studies retirement satisfaction: ``All in all,
would you say that your retirement has turned out to be very satisfying,
moderately satisfying, or not at all satisfying?''
% We have also looked at all studies that cite \citet{bender12}.
% Furtehrmore, his research  focuses on job satisfaction and uses data for the US only, and we focus
% on welfare, volunteering and study elderly in Europe. Furthermore his sample was
% restricted to individuals 51 to 61 years old, ours is 50$+$, and uses a sample
% of only about 6k people, and our sample is much larger. 
\citet{butrica2005satisfaction} also study retirement satisfaction, do focus on
volunteering (and interestingly suggest that volunteering in excess of 1k hours
per year does not help with satisfaction), but miss social transfers. All studies in a recent issue of Social Indicators Research \citep{jurges12} dedicated to aging and
wellbeing used other dependent variable than SWB, except one
\citep{angelini2012age}, which again, did not focus on social transfers and social capital/volunteering.
Studies that focus on happiness (SWB) and retirement also either miss social
transfers or volunteering
\citep{dingemans2014involuntary,dingemans2015retirement,nikolova2014employment,angelini2012age}.
 Many of such studies are more than ten years old and carried out in the US
\citep{wheeler98,ferring10}. % --older studies tend to use simpler methods, smaller samples, and fewer variables
%MAYBE:add more of this kind of lit
 Keep in mind that both volunteering and social transfers are very different in
 the US as compared to Europe \citep{tocqueville03,fischer10, alesina05al,alesina01,lipset00}.

%
 Volunteering predicts SWB. For a review see section 
 ``3.4.4. Community involvement and volunteering'' in \citet{dolan08al}. Cohort
 studies showed that volunteering had favorable effects on depression, life
 satisfaction, wellbeing but not on physical health \citep{jenkinson2013volunteering}.
%
What could be the causal pathway, how could volunteering cause SWB? Being a
volunteer transforms one's perceptions of herself, emotions, and knowledge of
the world \citep{wilson12B}. %p195
Volunteering boosts one's self esteem and buffers against stress, and
importantly it enhances mastery experiences
\citep{wilson12B}. %p198
%
 There is  some evidence of causal relationship between volunteering and
 happiness \citep{meier2008volunteering,borgonovi2008doing}. For instance, low status is associated
with low SWB only among those who do not volunteer--volunteering
might contribute to SWB by increasing empathy, shifting aspirations and by
moving the reference group to the relatively worse-off
\citep{borgonovi2008doing}. There are, of course, other causal pathways
possible. And we do not focus on causality in this correlational study.

Specifically, volunteering has been found to predict happiness among elderly (in
New Zealand) and the effect was moderated by
economic resources: poor benefit more from volunteering than rich
\citep{dulin2012volunteering}. And elderly benefit more than  younger people
\citep{van2000differential,wahrendorf06}. This may indicate that acting in
a social role beyond employment is beneficial for wellbeing.


\section{Data} 

We use the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) from
\url{http://www.share-project.org}.
 SHARE is a multidisciplinary and
cross-national panel covering health, socio-economic status,
social and family networks of over 50,000 persons aged 50$+$. 
We use  %Wave 4 mostly in 2011
 Wave 6 releaase 6.0
 conducted  in 2015, which has the largest number of
countries of all waves. 
%
For robustness, we have also used wave 4 and obtained similar results--results
are available upon request.  


% On the other hand, 
An advantage of SHARE is few missing values, 
 and there is imputed dataset without any values missing (we collapse dataset--take an average across categories on implicat variable). %also representative at nuts1 i guess!

                                
Especially earlier waves have few countries--SHARE sample grew substantially
over time and its country coverage almost doubled. Another advantage of wave 6 is that
data were collected in just one year (2015), %; eg may be problem in debbie haski and otehrs
while in earlier waves data were collected over longer spans--seasonality may be
a problem in studies using earlier waves of the dataset.

Key variables are discussed below and all variables are listed in appendix along
with their distributions and module source.
Most of the variables are from the imputed module; we have used other modules
only when variable was not available in imputed module. For instance, social capital including
volunteering comes from Activities (AC) module. 

%  We use a number of restrictions to drop
% respondents who cannot volunteer or are severly restricted to do so based on the
% criteria defined below.
 We use MN and CF modules to
exclude elderly in retirement homes and proxy observations.
%
We drop people who were in nursing homes (\~\ 1\%): such persons typically do
not have opportunity for volunteering. We also drop proxy respondents and only retain
main participants (\~\ 5\%). %leszek
                                %says monika says that there is a way to drop
                                %proxies based on that verbal score 
% we exclude those in opieki spolecznej mn024--they cannot volunterr (about .3k dropped); and we drop
% proxies, and only retain main participants (about 1.5k dropped)
 We drop respondents younger than 50 (\~\ 2\%). % We drop
 % respondentd with restricted mobility ($>=5$ on variable mobility measuring arm
 % function and fine motor limitations).

%just use  aweights with calibrated weights--that's what michal myck says!
% yeah but emailed share and they say to used pw

All dollar amounts are PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) adjusted. We adjust all money amounts with
PPP--arguably what matters for SWB is rather what money buys not its numeric value.

%ESS happiness question reads: "All things considered, how satisfied are you with your life as a whole nowadays? Please answer using this card, where 0 means extremely dissatisfied and 10 means extremely satisfied."
SHARE contains typical life satisfaction question: %http://www.share-project.org/fileadmin/pdf_questionnaire_wave_4/SHARE_generic_wave4_main_questionnaire.pdf
``On a scale from 0 to 10 where 0 means completely dissatisfied and 10 means
completely satisfied, how satisfied
are you with your life?'' The survey-based life
 satisfaction measure is closely correlated with similar objective
 measures such as brain activity \citep{layard05}.
 We also use CASP scale to measure subjective
wellbeing. Life satisfaction and CASP are correlated at .6.  SHARE contains a shortened 12-item version that has
desirable psychometric properties \citep{knesbeck2005quality}. CASP differs from
SWB: it factors in accomplishment and fulfillment, a concept related to Maslow's
hierarchy of needs \citep{maslow87}. Such measure is  very relevant at older age
when accomplishment and fulfillment are more relevant. %MAYBE see if that casp is in imputed part of data!
%MAYBE talk more about happiness scale (?) z Dominika Duda, Monika Oczkowska use CASP
%CASP allows for more comprehensive measurement and serves as a robustness check.
 SHARE's CASP, and CASP in general, is widely used--see for instance  \citet{perez2017psychometric,amit2010subjective,hyde03,hyde15,hyde2003measure,kim2015psychometric}. 

CASP contains  variables listed in table \ref{casp}. We used factor
analysis with varimax rotation to make CASP scale. Cronbach's alpha measuring its internal
consistency reliability is .82.  An index from factor analysis is more
meaningful than an index simply made by adding the components: factor analysis
weights components based on their fit or consistency--components that overlap
more are given higher weight.

In addition we control separately for disability and unemployment benefits and social
assistance. It is important to separate these variables because while old age
pensions should increase SWB, disability and unemployment benefits and social
assistance may decrease SWB as they indicate disadvantaged status, and possibly
social stigma. Note that we also control for disability and employment status. 

Volunteering is measured using AC module in two ways: ``Please look at card 34: which of the activities listed on this card - if any - have you done in the past twelve
months?'' ``Done voluntary or charity work'' coded as 0$=$'no' or 
1$=$'yes'  (ac035d1). 

The second item reads: ``How often in the past twelve
months did you [do voluntary or charity work% /cared for a sick or disabled
% adult/provided help to friends or neighbors/attended an educational or training
% course/go to a sport, social or other kind of club/taken part in the activities

]?'' on scale from 1$=$'less often' to 4$=$'almost
daily' (ac036\_1). We will also control for other  forms of social capital such
as relationships with other people: family members, friends, neighbors, or other acquaintances. %SN001_Introduction SHARE_generic_wave4_main_questionnaire.pdf

It is also important to think about what predicts or relates to
volunteering--these variables may be confounders, and failure to control for them may result in bias on
volunteering.  Predictors are: age, lack of resources (free
time), gender, race/immigrant status, education, labor force status, income,
family of origin \citet{wilson12,haski09}. %screw immigrant status---very few
                                %imigrants in europe who are old! i have otehrs
                                %in regressions!
 We will control for all of them, except race/immigrant status--European elderly
 are still a fairly homogeneous group. 


% One important variable is voluntariness of retirement, which
% affects retirement satisfaction substantially \citep{bender12}.  SHARE
% contains 2 sets of variables that could be used: EP064*, EP069*.
% There are mostly missing values, however, and we will not use these variable. Also note that  we study
% overall SWB, not retirement satisfaction, and it is arguably less affected by
% voluntariness of retirement. Furthermore, income, health, and other variables that we
% include already capture much of the voluntariness.


The key predictors of SWB that we will use as controls include income and
unemployment \citep[][]{ditella01moa,ditella01mob,ditella06m}, broadly
understood social
capital and health \citep{blanchflower11,dolan08al,bonsang12}. %look at disability!ferring-p184
We will also control for other predictors of SWB as suggested in the 
literature. In the context of present study we think that the following
variables are especially important: marital status
\citep[e.g.,][]{myers00,diener04s}, and age \citep{ferring10}. We also think
that grandchildren matter--they will affect SWB, and also time available to volunteering.
%
We also follow literature focusing on elderly in our choice of controls
\citep[e.g.,][]{meier2008volunteering,bonsang12,bender12,ferring10}, and while
we are unable to control for retirement voluntariness, we do control for
disability.

Finally, at country level, we use fixed effects to account for country-level
heterogeneity.
European countries are quite different and so volunteering (and other variables) mean something
different across countries.  Hence, we include a dummy for each country--it would pick up
everything that is specific about given country. This study's focus is overall
relationship between social capital, social transfers and SWB. In a followup
paper, we will focus on cross-country differences in these relationships. 
% will control for key ecological or environmental 
% predictors of happiness: income and governance \citep{helliwell14}.
% Income is measured as Gross Domestic Product per capita, Purchasing Power Parity
% adjusted. Data come from the world Bank's World Development Indicators at  
% \url{http://data.worldbank.org}.
% Governance is measured with an index of governance indicators:
%     Voice and Accountability,
%     Political Stability and Absence of Violence,
%     Government Effectiveness,
%     Regulatory Quality,
%     Rule of Law, and 
%     Control of Corruption 
% from \url{http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/index.aspx}.


In order to test our hypotheses, we will analyze data in regression framework. 
 All regressions are survey-weighted using $[pw=cciw_{w6}]$ syntax in Stata.
Happiness is an ordinal variable, and hence, it should be modeled using ordinal
models. We will use ordinary least squares (OLS). We know that
in case of happiness, OLS performs very well and results tend to be substantively
the same as those from discrete models \citep{carbonell04,blanchflower11}, and
OLS estimates are easier to interpret.  In addition, some observations on life
satisfaction are fractions (life satisfaction comes from imputed dataset), and
we use continuous CASP measure, hence, use of nonlinear models is not useful
here. 


\section{Results}


 We expect to
find, as stated in the hypotheses earlier, that social transfers, volunteering
and other forms of social capital predict greater SWB. We also expect to
find that there is a  certain substitution  between economic capital (transfers) and social
capital (volunteering). Perhaps, volunteering is not only cheaper but also almost equally
effective way of sustaining SWB among elderly. Volunteering is also likely to have
positive spillover effects. If an elderly volunteers to help another elderly,
both are  likely to become happier, and perhaps more people may follow the
example and volunteer as well. Social transfers, on the other hand, may have
negative externalities. We know that people compare and income is relative: the
more money others have, the more relatively deprived I am
\citep{michalos85,luttmer05,bender12}. Social transfers may have similar negative
effects. Indeed, there is anecdotal evidence--we have heard many people speaking
of others' pensions with envy, and envy is clearly detrimental to SWB \citep{mujcic17}.

We first predict SWB using income, wealth, and social transfers in table \ref{regA}; then we turn
to volunteering and other forms of social capital.
% We start with bivariate on transfers (+inc, wealth) and volunteering (+soc
% capital) separately and elaborate models in tables ref A B. 

A typical way to support oneself
before retirement is labor
income. We start with this basic relationship in column a1. Among elderly,
 typical way to support oneself is pension--added in b2--both income and pension 
have substantial and statistically significant effect on SWB. 
%
One of the key or indeed the most major way that European societies support
wellbeing of elderly is through pensions and other social transfers.
%
Other types of replacement income include unemployment, social assistance, and disability/sickness
benefits--added in a3. They all predict negative SWB--not unexpected--because
they not only add income but also proxy some considerable misfortune,
otherwise one would not be eligible for them. 
%
Correlations among social transfers are low, below .1. About two thirds of
sample receive pensions, and out of sample of about 65k, only about 1.2k receive
unemployment benefits,  about 1k receive social assistance and about 4.5k
receive disability/sickness benefits.
%
We have also tried nonlinear effects of pensions, labor income, and household
net worth, but we did not find much of a curvilinear
relationship--the line curves at high values, outside of typical range of data. If anything, using quadratic specification, the effect flips way in the right tail of the distribution.
In general, the more money, the higher the SWB among European elderly. 

Tetrachoric correlations among activities are low, ranging between .1 and .5
(only two above .4) except ``read books, magazines or newspapers'' is
correlated with ``did word or number games (crossword puzzles/Sudoku...)'' at .6.

Finally, column a4 adds other predictors of SWB as controls and the effect of labor income drops by
about half
and is as large as that of pension in this fullest specification. Column a4 also adds household net
worth, and as expected, it attenuates effect of labor income and pension--one
needs less of them if one has a stock of wealth. 
%

Columns a4-a8 repeat exercise but now with CASP as a dependent
variable--estimates are similar, except that they are
stronger--this is expected, again CASP was designed specifically
to measure wellbeing of elderly. 

%
% A5 adds housing situation:  Owner, tenant or rent free, Financial liabilities,
% Household net worth. FInally A6adds known predictors of swb as controls, and a7
% country dummies. Pensions remain significant, and importantly of considerable
% magnitude--about as high as effect of labor income.


Estimates on controls are mostly as expected with health being the key
factor. The effect of age may seem surprising--it is  positive--but in fact SWB mostly
increases with age and only at the very end it drops \citep{gwozdz10}, and this
is also what we find--$age^2$ is negative.

\end{spacing}


In sum, as expected, both labor income and replacement income in form of pension
have both significant and considerable effect on SWB. Hence, increasing
pensions, could lead to increased SWB. But from public policy standpoint such
solution is not sustainable--European budgets are already in red,  and societies are
aging. Can we increase wellbeing in other ways than social transfers? Yes we
can! We turn to social capital in table \ref{regB}.

We start with  volunteering only in b1. The base case is ``no volunteering'' and
 ``volunteering only almost every month'' already affects SWB significantly. There is not
much further increase for ``almost every week'' and then the positive effect actually decreases for ``almost
every day.'' This pattern persists when adding more controls. B2 adds other forms
of social capitals, and their addition cuts effect of volunteering by half.
%
 Interestingly, least social activity,  ``read books, magazines or newspapers'' has 
largest effect on SWB. The second largest effect is from ``sport, social or other
club'' and large effect is
expected--social engagement is key for SWB. Again, activities have low
correlations except ``read books, magazines or newspapers'' is
correlated with ``did word or number games (crossword puzzles/Sudoku...)'' at
.6.

% LATER: maybe do index of
% these other variables; can aggreagte them like into one and interact with
% volunteering and see if effect there diff for those engaged otherwhise and

B3 adds  controls for employment--an important factor to consider when
volunteering--because those who are employed have less time and higher
opportunity cost of volunteering. Surprisingly, estimates on volunteering remain
unchanged. We will return to employment in next section.
Addition of usual controls in b4 attenuates effect of volunteering but it
remains significant.

Comparison of effect sizes of social transfers effects from table \ref{regA} with  
 social capital from table \ref{regB} reveals that pension (and labor income) are
 strong her  predictors of SWB, even by about two-fold,  than social capital, notably volunteering.
%
Finally, in table \ref{regCw6} we include both, social transfers and social
capital,  to see how they substitute/complement
when both included in the same model--we are interested in what is the net
effect of each.
%
Table \ref{regCw6} repeats base estimate b1 from table \ref{regB} in c1 and
adds pension. % For
% robustness, we also report an analogous model from wave 4 in c1W4--resuls are
% similar: for both waves volnteering and pensions matter about the same for SWB,
%  and if anything, volunteering can have larger effect.
% 
Column c2 adds full set of controls and estimates are much attenuated
on both volunteering and pension, but they remain about the same, now pension
being slightly stronger.
%
Again, results for CASP are more statistically
significant and have stronger effect sizes--arguably CASP captures SWB better
than life satisfaction as it uses multiple items. A comforting result is
that CASP models show the same patterns as in previous life satisfaction
models. In full models, the effect of pension is about the same as the effect of volunteering.

% casp v swb mearure, lifests, and results are similar, albeit
% weaker--not surprising as casp was specifically designed for elderly, and hence,
% is arguably a better meaure od SWB than lifests in case of elderly

The result worth noting is that volunteering only ``almost every month'' already
contributes significantly to SWB. ``Almost every week'' contributes most
to SWB, more than volunteering ``almost every day.'' A curvilinear
relationship is common in the literature--there may be excessive overcommitment
and ``emphatic over-arousal''  \citep{wilson12B}.%p199

\section*{More volunteering, more SWB, but at the same rate for everyone?}
% per testing for substitution/complementarity there may be sth more formal eg
% https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4380566/

 Employed or low income elderly may have less opportunity for
 volunteering than those not working full time and with enough income to make a
 living. % assuming thinc variable includes social transfers
%
Arguably, to afford volunteering you have to have basic income. Only then you can
satisfy  higher needs on Maslow pyramid  such as the need to belong
\citep{maslow87}. On the other hand, the high earners and wealthy have higher
opportunity cost--they should rather donate money than time.\footnote{Clearly, a
high earner has a high opportunity cost--she would contribute more by working
more and then donating rather than volunteering. But also so does a wealthy
person has an opportunity cost--she could spend her time investing her wealth
rather than volunteering, and then donate part of the earned income.}

%%%%
Indeed, again, \citet{borgonovi2008doing} found that low status is associated
with low SWB only among those who do not volunteer--volunteering
might contribute to SWB by increasing empathy, shifting aspirations and by
moving the reference group to the relatively worse-off.
%%%%

Earlier,  to see an effect from each, we have separated streams of income and focused on pensions. 
Now we use total household income measure to capture its entirety--we would
like to know the effect of volunteering by different total household income
levels. We will also be using wealth stock measure: household net worth.
%
What matters for one's SWB is not only how much she makes but how much she has.

In this last part of the analysis we try to answer a question whether
volunteering can be more useful for certain socio economic groups. % In
% particluar we are interested in effect of total income or wealth--is there
% substitution? And is there social class effect?
 We start by defining groups according to income, wealth, and pensions.  
 Results are shown in table \ref{regDw6}, but when it comes to interactions, it
 is probably easier to interpret predicted values in graph \ref{mar}.
% We find that indeed there is some evidence for that--
The more nonvolunteer (solid line) makes or owns, the higher is her SWB--the poor and the middle
class seem to benefit more from volunteering than the rich. \citet{dulin2012volunteering} also found that poor benefit more than rich. Pensions, on the
other hand, do not affect the volunteering-SWB relationship.
%
SWB is about the same for volunteers and nonvolunteers at income of 60k or
wealth of 600k for life satisfaction and 
at about total income of 100k or 1m tot net worth for CASP.  
% 
How can these results be explained?

% or take scanario of middle class family with ??? v rich family ???: for the midlle
% class the rlationship betwene volnteering and swb is about 2x
%there are some such results in dofile



Interestingly,  the
relationship with pension is flat or even opposite to that of income or wealth--the higher the
pension, the stronger the effect from volunteering.\footnote{Still, results are
statistically insignificant for life satisfaction and only significant for CASP.} One explanation is that
pensions do not require time (as opposed to labor income), and provide peace of
mind and let one engage in volunteering as opposed to paid labor. 

With income and household net worth: clearly there is an opportunity cost. The rich could give to charity couple
millions, rather than help the kids cross the street. People give what they
have--rich have money, poor have time.  Note that prosocial spending also
contributes to SWB \citep{aknin13}.
%
With pensions the relationship is flat because there is no opportunity cost--you
get what you get.

%LATER wonder if if opportunity cost if inteacted with other social activities

Likewise, results in table \ref{regEw6} show that elders
who are retired derive more wellbeing from volunteering. This makes sense--they
have more time and lower opportunity cost.

\section*{Conclusion and discussion}

We found support for $H_1:$ The more social transfers and social capital,
especially in the form of volunteering, the more SWB.
This study adds another piece of evidence to a line of research arguing that
volunteering is a productive aging strategy
\citep[e.g.,][]{wilson12B,hank09}--here productive means increasing SWB.
It is especially important given that the burden of aging %hank05 used the term
 is increasing--all European countries are aging--and younger generations will
 have to increasingly pay more for the elderly. It is important to highlight that elderly have greater potential to volunteer as
they have more time, especially the elderly who are retired. But even those in
paid labor, arguably tend to have less harried schedule than younger workers.
% : those that are active live longer and better; if you
% do nothing you die qucik


We also found support for $H_2:$ When considered simultaneously pensions and volunteering have about the same effect on SWB.
Yet, volunteering (or anything else for that matter) cannot be a complete alternative
or a substitute to social transfers--one needs to be able to afford necessities.
But it can be a significant complement and it can tradeoff some of the decrease in transfers.

There is a related issue of retirement age--while people live longer, it is
 politically difficult to increase retirement age--but this is not economically
 sustainable. Volunteering can help--for instance, people can still be retiring
 earlier but if they remain productive through volunteering they can generate
 free products and services, which would ease budget expenditures and help with
 deficits. Indeed, in spirit of nudging as opposed to forcing people
 \citep{thaler08}, we suggest such policy: increase retirement age, but allow a
 person to retire early if she volunteers.\footnote{The devil is in the details
   of course--it remains to be worked out how to exactly design and implement
   such policy.}

Europe is aging: Fewer babies are born, and Europeans live longer, and healthcare
costs are increasing. So people live longer and in better shape, and at the same
time retirement age increase is opposed, so there are more untapped resources in
terms of labor that elderly could perform. We suggest volunteering--especially
in countries with low levels of volunteering, there is a great deal of
potential.\footnote{Our preliminary results (not shown here) suggest that the
  effect of volunteering on SWB has strongest potential for growth among
  countries with low levels of volunteering.}  
%
%
 For instance, in western countries many public utility tasks are performed by volunteers such
as helping kids cross the street. In east, on the other hand, these activities
are often performed by paid labor that could be used better elsewhere, for
instance, in Poland % Straz Miejska
 city employees often helps kids cross the street. %leszek morawski per ozarow
 In the US, it is often volunteers.

In this study we focused on overall patterns (controlling for country level fixed
effects). Future research can explore differences across countries. 
%
The goal of this study was to focus on the general relationships and the tradeoff
between economic and social capitals.

SHARE are very rich data and there can be much more done in terms of narrowing
down and measuring pensions and volunteering. And related concepts can be
measured, too. For instance, we have found that volunteering works better for
poorer persons and suggested that for richer persons giving may contribute more
to their SWB. This can be tested using FT001, FT002, FT003, and other FT
variables.  



Future research could look at effect of earlier life experiences effect on successful
aging. For instance, \citet{pruchno2010successful,pruchno2010two} found in the US that incarceration,
 marital, work, and volunteer statuses, as well as moderate
alcohol consumption affect successful aging--such approach could be
replicated in Europe using SHARELIFE, SHARE's module focused on people's life
histories. In particular, it would be interesting to examine effect of earlier
volunteering in life on successful aging later--perhaps, not only
volunteering later in life, but also earlier has a positive effect. 

As any correlational study, causality cannot be established. While panel data
does not help much with causality,  (an experiment or natural experiment is
needed), panel data does help controlling for unobservable heterogeneity if it is
time constant. 

We did not test for actual substitution, ie take away one (social  capital) and replace
with another one (economic capital) and SWB remains constant--our results
suggest that indeed it may be the case (at least to some degree; again, one
needs at least some economic capital that cannot be easily replaced with other
capitals). It is a great topic for future research.

To advance policy making and
administration we should ask how much happiness will a policy bring
about. There are always limited resources, and there are many competing needs: education, safety, public
health, and so forth. One metric to help direct spending is SWB.\footnote{Of
  course, it is not the only metric, neither a perfect one. There are other
  considerations--notably not everything that makes us happy is the right thing
  to do. However, if an activity (e.g., volunteering) has other benefits and few if any
  disadvantages, then SWB yardstick is more appropriate.}
Key  advantage of happiness yardstick is that it overcomes difficulty
of measuring utility in social welfare, for instance, it helps to answer
a question whether we should  invest
limited resources in pensions, healthcare, or infrastructure.
% You don't have to be a utilitarian to agree that a major goal of
% public policy making is achieving ``the greatest happiness for the greatest
% number.'' 

%--------------------

Neighborhood support groups have always played a key role in helping the poor
survive \citep{saegert2002social}, and so do individual persons play a key role
helping other poor \citep{mazelis2017surviving}. Most countries experience
rising inequality \citep{piketty03,mackintosh13,oecd08,verbeek15}--the middle
class is diminishing\footnote{For the world as a whole, the inequality is
  decreasing due to the poor countries, notably China, catching up--in many poor
  countries, middle class is actually increasing.}, and it is becoming two classes: the rich and the
rest. Our results suggest that volunteering may not be the viable strategy for the rich, but it is for the rest.

%FOR NOW PUT IN APP; MAY BRING BACK IF REVIEWERS COMPLAIN
For robustness we attempted pooling waves together in order to use panel data
techniques such as fixed effects to account for unobserved personal
characteristics that arguably affect volunteering \citep{meier08}. 
First, there are only 5 waves\footnote{Wave 3 (SHARELIFE) is not comparable to others and
is not really a wave per se.} available, as compared to more than a
dozen in the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) or British Household Panel
Survey (BHPS). Second, country coverage varies substantially across waves.
 More problematically, there is little overlap across persons, unfortunately.
Astonishing more than half of respondents from wave 4 does not match wave 5, and
about half of respondents from 5 does not match wave 6.\footnote{%as per lm
This may be also due
  to the addition of new respondents in subsequent waves. The study covers the 50+ population,
  so in each new round SHARE needs to add new observations. In some
  countries, an attempt was made to try to find more money for research. For
  example, in Poland round 7 will count probably 5000 people, that is, it will
  increase almost twice.}  Therefore, we conclude
that there is little point in using panel techniques.
%
Indeed, this is what the literature argues, too. For instance, ``with 
high attrition rates, however, the number of cases  in the panel decreases quickly, 
thus  reducing  the  base  for  longitudinal  analyses'' \citep{blom2011sample}. 
% \citet{banks2011attrition}: in the SHARE survey of twelve continental European countries the combined lost to sample from attrition and mortality between the first and second waves alone was 40\%. Since mortality rates are if anything lower in continental Europe, this higher sample lost is due to even greater rates of attrition in SHARE
